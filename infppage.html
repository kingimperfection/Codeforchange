    We feel that homelessness is a big deal in our societies.We think that if we connected with a soup kitchen and had them make sandwiches we could make somewhat of a difference to the homeless community. To make this fun we will add a point system in which you take picture with the homeless person with the sandwich you gave them and add  #hashtagfeedthehomeless. If we make a certain mark of points biweekly than we will donate to the person with the most points preferred charity.
