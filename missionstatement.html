    <h1>The Goal of Meals On The Move is to help feed the homeless people and families 
    all while earning cool rewards and prizes.</h1>
    In January of 2015, 564,708 people
    were conducted to be homeless. Of that number 206,286 of those people were
    families while 358,422 people were indivually chronically homeless, meaning they 
    had no absoulute way of finding real homes or shelters to live in so they had to live 
    on the street.</p> 
    
    <p> In New York alone of there are about 58,000 homeless men, women, and children 
    and even of that number at least 3,100 of those people live and sleep on the street so every 
    1in 147 people living in New York are homeless or chronically homeless.</p>
